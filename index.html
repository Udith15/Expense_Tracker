            <li>“It is very very easy, as soon as you get a receipt you can scan it, the AI will capture all relevant information and it is very 
                little interaction to get to the final sumbmission of the expense. It is so easy!!!”</li><br>
            <li>“Expensify has a great UI interface and is very intuitive to use. I particularly like the funcitonality of taking a picture of a receipt and having it uploaded
                 to my account. I also like that I can send an email and the smart-scanner puts it into my expenses.”</li><br>
            <li>“I've never met someone that enjoys doing their expenses. Following business trips or even a few weeks in the office, the last thing that
                 someone wants to do is take time out of their day/week to sort through, and enter receipts. </li><br>
